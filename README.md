 # The Savior — Static Website
 
 This folder contains a modern, responsive static website for "The Savior" detergent company. The site uses Tailwind CSS (via CDN), Font Awesome, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and animations.
 
 Files added:
 
 - `index.html` — Main site markup.
 - `assets/css/styles.css` — Small custom CSS for animations and tweaks.
 - `assets/js/main.js` — JavaScript for menu toggle, smooth scroll, product rendering, testimonials, and form validation.
 
 How to view:
 
 1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use Live Server).
 
 Notes:
 
 - The project uses external CDNs (Tailwind, Font Awesome). The images are referenced from Unsplash for demo purposes.
 - No build step is required.
 
If you want any changes to copy, content, or functionality (cart behavior, backend integration), tell me what to add next.
